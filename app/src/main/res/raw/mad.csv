c1,Introduction:%nMobile application development is the course of action by which application software is designed and developed for hand-held devices like mobile phones, personal digital assistants, etc.
c1,In the past couple of years the growth of mobile phone market has generated a huge demand for various mobile applications.
c1,Numerous mobile phone applications are available that simplify various tasks for the users due to which we saw an accelerated growth of software/application development for mobile devices.
c2,Java Constants:%nA constant is a value that cannot be changed.%nExamples of integer constants%n354 -37%n0%n246543 (no commas).
c2,Java Variables:%nA variable has these attributes:%nName The string of letters in a program used to designate a variable.
c2,A name should start with a letter and consist of letters and digits.%nVariables in names are case sensitive (capitalization matters).
c2,The naming convention in Java is to start a variable name with a lower case letter.%nNew words within a name with a name start with a capital letter.
c2,Example variable declarations:%nint maxAge;%nint x y selectedIndex;%nchar a b;%nboolean flag;%ndouble maxVal massInKilos;
c3,Classes in Java:%nA class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.%nFollowing is a sample of a class.
c3,Example:%npublic class Dog {%nString breed;%nint age;%n String color;%nvoid barking() {%n}%nvoid hungry() {%n}%nvoid sleeping() {%n}%n}
c3,Arrays in Java:%nJava provides a data structure the array which stores a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
c3,Declaring Array Variables:%nTo use an array in a program you must declare a variable to reference the array and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable
c3,Syntax:%ndataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.%nor%ndataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.
c4,Decision Structure:%nThe if statement is the simplest example of a decision structure in Java. In an if statement a logical test is made which can evaluate to either true or false. If the result of the test is true the statements in the if branch are executed.
c4,For example:%nThe if and else if statement[edit]%nYou can use the if statement with the else if and else statements. The structure is:
c4,if(boolean) {%n    //Java code...%n} else if(boolean2) {%n //Java code...%n}
c4,It means if boolean is true then do ... if not and boolean2 is true then do .... For example in order to write out If 5 is equal to 6 then write 'equal' to the console. If not and 7 is equal to 7 write '7=7' to the console:
c4,if(5 == 6) {%nSystem.out.println(equal);%n} else if(7 == 7) {%nSystem.out.println(7=7);%n}%nOnly 7=7 will be printed. However if we replaced the first boolean with 5==5 only equal would be printed.
c5,Designing Mobile User interface:%nA mobile user interface (mobile UI) is the graphical and usually touch-sensitive display on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet that allows the user to interact with the deviceâ€™s apps features content and functions.
c5,Mobile user interface (UI) design requirements are significantly different from those for desktop computers. The smaller screen size and touch screen controls create special considerations in UI design to ensure usability readability and consistency.
c5,In a mobile interface symbols may be used more extensively and controls may be automatically hidden until accessed. The symbols themselves must also be smaller and there is not enough room for text labels on everything which can cause confusion.
c6,Displaying Images:%nAndroid phones feature large high-resolution displays that are perfect for displaying images in your application. Images are an important way of conveying information to your users without explicitly stating it. Typically images are displayed using the built-in image view. This view takes care of the loading and optimizing of the image freeing you to focus on app-specific details like the layout and content. Unless you need special optimizations for your application you should take advantage of the built-in image view whenever possible.
c6,ImageView and Resources:%nThe simplest way to display an image is to declare an ImageView in your layout file and set its source to a resource in your project. Image resources are placed in the /res/drawable folders. This example will display an image named icon:
c6,<ImageView%n    android:id=@+id/image%n    android:layout_width=match_parent%n    android:layout_height=match_parent%n    android:scaleType=center%n    android:src=@drawable/icon />
