c1,Introduction,Introduction:%nComputer programming is composing/authoring of a process/procedure for doing something the source code representation of algorithms - in great detail.%nproc-ess / Noun:%nA series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end.%npro-ce-dure / Noun:%nA series of actions conducted in a certain order.%nal-go-rithm / Noun:%nAn ordered set of steps to solve a problem.
c1,Introduction,Since computers do not understand English and it would be impossible for a human to write a large program as a series of binary numbers that the computer can understand we need something in between.  High-level programming languages currently fit in this category.  Given a programming language that you have chosen you then follow its rules for composing statements (or expressions) that instruct the computer to do what you want.
c1,Introduction,Because a computer is simply a very fast manipulator of bits (ones and zeros) through the the power of abstraction computer scientists have layered levels of object representation and functionality one on top of another.  We have now been working on refining and extending these layers for over half of a century.
c2,Variables and DataTypes,Variables:%nVariables store everything in your program.%n• The purpose of any useful program is to modify variables.%n• In a program every variable has:%n– Name (Identifier)%n– Data Type%n– Size%n– Value
c2,Variables and DataTypes,Types of Variable%n• Local variables are those that are in scope within a specific part of the program (function procedure method or subroutine depending on the programming language employed).%n%n • Global variables are those that are in scope for the duration of the programs execution. They can be accessed by any part of the program and are read write for all statements that access them.
c2,Variables and DataTypes,DataTypes:%nIn computer science and computer programming a data type or simply type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. %nMost programming languages support various types of data%nfor example:%nInteger%nFloating-point%ncharacter%nstring%nBoolean.
c3,Functions and Modules,Functions:%nFunctions Encapsulate a task (they combine many instructions into a single line of code). Most programming languages provide many built-in functions that would otherwise require many steps to accomplish %nfor example%ncomputing the square root of a number. In general%cwe do not care how a function does what it does only that it %idoes it!%i.
c3,Functions and Modules,When a function is called the program leaves the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Thus the function flow of control is:%nThe program comes to a line of code containing a function call.%nThe program enters the function (starts at the first line in the function code).%nAll instructions inside of the function are executed from top to bottom.%nThe program leaves the function and goes back to where it started from.%nAny data computed and RETURNED by the function is used in place of the function in the original line of code.
c3,Functions and Modules,Modules:%n1. In software a module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one or more independently developed modules that are not combined until the program is linked. A single module can contain one or several routines.%n%n2. In hardware a module is a self-contained component.
c4,Strings,Strings:%nIn computer programming a string is traditionally a sequence of characters either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed or it may be fixed (after creation).
c4,Strings,for example:%nIn C++ We use strings like that%n #include<iostream>%nusing namespace std;%nint main(){%nchar greeting[6] = {'H'%c 'e'%c 'l'%c 'l'%c 'o'%c '\0'};%ncout << %iGreeting message: %i;%ncout << greeting << endl;%nreturn0;%n}
c5,Computer Graphics,What is Computer Graphics?%nComputer Graphics name itself says that making Graphics Visual presentations of data using computer and displayed on the Output device monitor of a computer.%nUsing Computer Graphics one can notice Group of Images%cImage or videos on Computer Monitor screens.
c5,Computer Graphics,Using Computer Graphics  we can create%cOperate and Store various geometric objects and its images.%nAs the name Computer Graphics saying that all about drawings%cmovies%cPhotos and more. So entire CG is not associate with any Text or Sound.%nCG is the sub part of Compute Science which studies about manipulating visual content Synthesizing digitally.
c5,Computer Graphics,Uses of Computer Graphics:%nThere are several uses of CG which are very useful in the current scenario.
c5,Computer Graphics,Some of its uses includes%nA).Computer program Development%nB).Making movies%nC).Video Games (Ex: Platformers Role-playing games sidescrollers first person shooters)%nD).Catalogs designing%nE).Creating Commercial Arts%nF).Scientific Modelling (Ex: Weather Forecasts%cMeteorological data).
c6,File input and output,File input and output:%nC++ input/output streams are primarily defined by iostream  a header file that is part of the C++ standard library (the name stands for Input/Output Stream). In C++ and its predecessor the C programming language there is no special syntax for streaming data input or output.
c6,File input and output,for example:%n// basic file operations%n#include <iostream>%n#include <fstream>%nusing namespace std;%nint main () {%n  ofstream myfile;%n  myfile.open (%iexample.txt%i);%n  cout << %iWriting this to a file.%i<<endl;%n  myfile.close();%n  return 0;%n}
