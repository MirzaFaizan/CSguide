csharpQ1,A mechanism that binds together code and data in manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.In short it isolates a particular code and data from all other codes and data. A well-defined interface controls the access to that particular code and data.,Abstraction,Polymorphism,Inheritance,Encapsulation,Encapsulation,Explanation: By definition.
csharpQ1,Correct way of declaration of object of the following class is ?,name n = new name();,n = name();,name n = name();,n = new name();,name n = new name();,Explanation:None.
csharpQ1,The data members of a class by default are ?,protected%cpublic,private%cpublic,private,public,private,Explanation:None.
csharpQ1,Which of the following keyword is used to change data and behavior of a base class by replacing a member of the base class with a new derived member?,Overloads,Overrides,new,base,new,Explanation:None.
csharpQ1,Correct way to overload +operator?,public sample operator + ( sample a%c sample b),public abstract operator + (sample a%csample b),public static sample operator + (sample a%c sample b),All of the mentioned,All of the mentioned,Explanation:None.
csharpQ1,Which of the following statements is correct?,Each derived class does not have its own version of a virtual method,If a derived class does not have its own version of virtual method then one in base class is used,By default methods are virtual,All of the mentioned,By default methods are virtual,Explanation:None.
csharpQ1,Selecting appropriate method out of number of overloaded methods by matching arguments in terms of number type and order and binding that selected method to object at compile time is called?,Static binding,Static Linking,Compile time polymorphism,All of the mentioned,All of the mentioned,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,The ref keyword can be used with which among the following?,Static function/subroutine,Static data,Instance function/subroutine,All of the mentioned,Static function/subroutine,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,To implement delegates the necessary condition is?,class declaration,inheritance,run time polymorphism,exceptions,class declaration,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,Suppose a Generic class called as SortObjects is to be made capable of sorting objects of any type(integer%csingle byte etc).Then which of the following programming constructs is able to implement the comparison function?,interface,encapsulation,delegate,attribute,delegate,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,To generate a simple notification for an object in runtime the programming construct to be used for implementing this idea?,namespace,interface,delegate,attribute,delegate,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,Choose the incorrect statement among the following about the delegate?,delegates are of reference types,delegates are object oriented,delegates are type safe,none of the mentioned,none of the mentioned,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,Which among the following is the correct statement about delegate declaration ?delegate void del(int i);,on declaring the delegate, a class called del is created,the del class is derived from the MulticastDelegate class,the del class will contain a one argument constructor and an invoke() method,all of the mentioned,all of the mentioned,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,What is the advantage of the multithreading program?,Enables to utilize the idle and executing time present in most programs,Enables to utilize the idle time present in most programs,Both a & b,Only b,Only b,Explanation:The principal advantage of multithreading is that it enables us to write very efficient programs because it lets us utilize the idle time that is present in most programs.
csharpQ2,Select the two type of threads mentioned in the concept of multithreading:,foreground,background,only foreground,both foreground & background,both foreground & background,Explanation:None.
csharpQ2,Number of threads that exists for each of the processes that occurs in the program:,atmost 1,atleast 1,only 1,both a & c,both a & c,Explanation:All processes have at least one thread for execution%c which is usually called the main thread because it is the primary thread that is executed when our program begins.From the main thread%c we can create other threads.
csharpQ2,Choose the namespace which supports multithreading programming:,System.net,System.Linq,System.Threading,All of the mentioned,System.Threading,Explanation:The classes that support multithreaded programming are defined in the System.Threading namespace. Thus%c you will usually include this statement at the start of any multithreaded program.
